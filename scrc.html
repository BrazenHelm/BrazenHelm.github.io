            <a href="https://www.secondimpactgames.com/scrc.html"><i>Super Crazy Rhythm Castle</i></a> 
            is a rhythm-puzzle-party game mashup I worked on at 
            <a href="https://www.secondimpactgames.com/">Second Impact Games</a>. The core of 
            the game is figuring out how to progress through an absurd world and story, with the 
            main recurring mechanic being Guitar Hero style rhythm play. My favourite levels are 
            those which require you to multitask, balancing the needs of several different parts 
            of the level, all of which are needed to win.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being in a small company (10 people at its largest) meant that I was able to 
            contribute to many different aspects of development and got to know all parts of 
            the codebase.
          </p>
          <p>
            Probably my proudest contribution was the implementation of network code for the PS4 
            and PS5. This was not something that anyone at the company had prior experience with. 
            The code connects, authenticates and sends messages between devices when 
            requested by the platform-agnositic network system. It also updates the PlayStation 
            system with the information it needs, such as creating player sessions and updating 
            activities using competitive matches, ensuring compliance with Sony's technical 
            requirements checklist. As part of this, I identified and reported a bug in the Unity 
            PS5 network plugin that prevented the score for a competitive match from being 
            submitted; this bug was quickly patched.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also very much enjoyed gameplay programming for several levels, especially the 
            close collaboration this required between myself and whichever artist was assigned 
            to that room.
          </p>
          <p>My other contributions included </p>
          <ul> 
            <li>The localisation system, including handling of non-Latin fonts and audit tools</li>
            <li>Steam achievements and stats </li>
            <li>Displaying appropriate gamepad and keyboard prompts for user input on all platforms</li>
            <li>Debugging on all platforms the game released on (Steam, PS4 and PS5, Xbox One and Series, and Switch)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is by far the biggest project I've ever been a part of. I'm very happy with 
            both my individual impact and how it turned out as a whole.
