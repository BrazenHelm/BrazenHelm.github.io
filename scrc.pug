        <a href="https://www.secondimpactgames.com/scrc.html"><i>Super Crazy Rhythm Castle</i></a> 
        is a rhythm-puzzle-party game mashup I worked on at 
        <a href="https://www.secondimpactgames.com/">Second Impact Games</a>. The core of 
        the game is figuring out how to progress through an absurd world and story, with the 
        main recurring mechanic being Guitar Hero style rhythm play. My favourite levels are 
        those which require you to multitask, balancing the needs of several different parts 
        of the level, all of which are needed to win.

        Being in a small company (10 people at its largest) meant that I was able to 
        contribute to many different aspects of development and got to know all parts of 
        the codebase.
    p.
        Probably my proudest contribution was the implementation of network code for the PS4 
        and PS5. This was not something that anyone at the company had prior experience with. 
        The code connects, authenticates and sends messages between devices when 
        requested by the platform-agnositic network system. It also updates the PlayStation 
        system with the information it needs, such as creating player sessions and updating 
        activities using competitive matches, ensuring compliance with Sony's technical 
        requirements checklist. As part of this, I identified and reported a bug in the Unity 
        PS5 network plugin that prevented the score for a competitive match from being 
        submitted; this bug was quickly patched.
    p.
        I also very much enjoyed gameplay programming for several levels, especially the 
        close collaboration this required between myself and whichever artist was assigned 
        to that room.

        My other contributions included

        li The localisation system, including handling of non-Latin fonts and audit tools
        li Steam achievements and stats 
        li Displaying appropriate gamepad and keyboard prompts for user input on all platforms
        li Debugging on all platforms the game released on (Steam, PS4 and PS5, Xbox One and Series, and Switch)

        This is by far the biggest project I've ever been a part of. I'm very happy with 
        both my individual impact and how it turned out as a whole.
