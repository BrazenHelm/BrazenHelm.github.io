            Cave is scene of a low-poly, procedurally generated cave with a shaft of bright
            sunlight from a hole in the wall to illuminate it. The scene is rendered using
            DirectX 11, based on my earlier project (Immortal). The camera can be controlled
            with first person controls using mouse and keyboard inputs; there is collision
            detection and handling to avoid clipping into the cave walls.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cave mesh is generated using a cellular automaton, which acts 
            similarly to Conway's famous <i>Game of Life</i> to produce a pattern of filled 
            and empty cells in a cubic grid. Scalar values are assigned to each grid cell,
            then marching cubes is used to build an approximate isosurface for the mesh.
          </p>
          <p>
            The volumetric lighting in the scene uses a fine "god ray" mesh which is only
            visible when in direct sunlight, computed using a shadow map. The bloom effect 
            is made using a combination of three two-pass box blurs, each performed on a 
            different downsampled version of the original god ray render, as a more efficient 
            way to approximate a wide Gaussian blur.
