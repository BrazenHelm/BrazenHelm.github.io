            <i>Investigating Puzzle Difficulty Assessment: Minimum Solution Length is the Best 
            Indicator of Logic Maze Difficulty</i> is an original research project for my MSc 
            at Abertay University. It concerns the evaluation of puzzle difficulty by a computer, 
            investigating which properties of a puzzle are the most useful in determining 
            difficulty. The puzzles used were logic mazes of a type seen in <i>The Witness</i> 
            (2016).
          </p>
          <p>
            I created 30 logic maze puzzles by hand and a website on which volunteers could solve 
            these puzzles and rate their difficulty. It also included a brief, tutorial for the 
            puzzles, and a debrief. The data collected from this website was used to estimate the 
            true difficulty of each puzzles for humans. The website was created using the Django 
            framework for Python, also involving elements of HTML, Javascript and CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            While collecting data from the website, I created two solvers in C++. One solved the 
            puzzles using brute force and the other used an expert system designed to imitate a 
            human-like method of solving. The first solver could produce values such as the 
            length of the shortest solution to the maze. The second solver could produce values 
            such as the average number of logical rules applied before reaching a solution. I 
            considered many such values as potential predicators of puzzle difficulty.
          </p>
          <p>
            I analysed the datasets produced by my 124 volunteers and 2 computer solvers using 
            SPSS to determine which predictors were most useful. The conclusion was that in the 
            case of this specific type of puzzle, the minimum solution length was the best 
            indicator of difficulty.
