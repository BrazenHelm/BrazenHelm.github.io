            Cars are driven around a racetrack by an artificial neural network. These drivers 
            are optimised using the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. 
            The operation of the genetic algorithm can be controlled using commands in a console 
            window, and the results can be written to a file. The graphics in the project use 
            the SFML library.
          </p>
          <p>
            The inputs of a car's neural network are given by sensors which measure the distance 
            from the car to the nearest wall in various directions. The outputs correspond to 
            controls for accelerate, brake, turn left, and turn right.
          </p>
          <p>
            The algorithm produced many highly competent networks, much better than a human
            player. Using separate tracks for training and testing indicated that after 25 or 
            so generations, the drivers would usually begin to suffer from overfitting.
