            Immortal is a 3D scene of a famous historical chess position, with the board and
            pieces lit by a flickering candle. The candlelight casts shadows which are
            calculated in real time using a shadow map. The scene is rendered using DirectX 11.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meshes are loaded from .obj files and textures from .png files, allowing objects to
            be rendered in the world. Each object also keeps track of its own material, position,
            rotation and scale, while higher level classes deal with different shaders, input
            layouts and other objects that are bound to the graphics pipeline. Music is also
            loaded from a .wav file to play in the background.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scene implements ambient, diffuse and specular lighting (with the Phong reflection
            model) from a single light source, the candle. The candle's position and attenuation
            (constant, linear and quadratic) are varied at each frame on a bounded random walk
            around a fixed centre to give the impression of flickering. A shadow map is used to
            calculate shadows in real time.
