  At <a href="https://www.secondimpactgames.com/">Second Impact Games</a> I worked mainly on 
  <a href="https://www.secondimpactgames.com/scrc.html"><i>Super Crazy Rhythm Castle</i></a>,
  the chaotic musical adventure (released November 2023). As a member of
  a very small studio I got to work on many different parts of the game, 
  including as the primary programmer for
</p>
<ul> 
  <li>Network code on PS4 and PS5</li>
  <li>Gameplay programming in levels <i>The Vault</i>, <i>The Thief Prince</i> and <i>The Game Garage</i></li>
  <li>The localisation system, including handling of non-Latin fonts and audit tools</li>
  <li>Steam achievements and stats</li>
  <li>Displaying appropriate gamepad and keyboard prompts for user input on all platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>The game was programmed in C# using the Unity Engine.</p>
